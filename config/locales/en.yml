  # FAQ section
  faq:
    short_title: "FAQ"
    title: "Frequently Asked Questions"
    subtitle: "Answers to questions about LibreMedia's licensing and business model."
    q1:
      question: "This is not open source!"
      answer: "Correct. LibreMedia does not claim to be open source and does not use an OSI-approved license. The code is public by design, not by obligation."
    q2:
      question: "You're abusing the open source community?"
      answer: "No. We do not mislabel the project, do not use open source licenses deceptively, and do not restrict rights retroactively. Everything is explicit from day one."
    q3:
      question: "Why not AGPL?"
      answer: "Because AGPL is incompatible with sustainable SaaS development and does not effectively prevent commercial parasitism or service cloning."
    q4:
      question: "Why can't I host this myself?"
      answer: "Because hosting and operating the platform IS the product. LibreMedia already provides a free non-commercial tier via the official SaaS. Self-hosting or running your own service is outside the scope of permitted use."
    q5:
      question: "Why allow pull requests if the product is commercial?"
      answer: "Because transparency and quality benefit everyone. Contributors submit changes knowingly and under clear terms."
    q6:
      question: "What if I fork it privately?"
      answer: "Forking or modifying the code beyond evaluation or contribution purposes requires a commercial license. Unauthorized use violates the license and applicable law."

  # Partners section
  partners:
    title: "Partner Media and Opinion Leaders"
    subtitle: "Free media means independent media. True independence requires financial independence — supported by conscious audiences."
    join_message: "Join a community that supports its own media — no state propaganda, no corrupt sponsors, no censorship."
