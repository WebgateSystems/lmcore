## "This is not open source!"

Correct.

LibreMedia does not claim to be open source and does not use an OSI-approved
license. The code is public by design, not by obligation.

---

## "You're abusing the open source community"

No.

We do not mislabel the project, do not use open source licenses
deceptively, and do not restrict rights retroactively.

Everything is explicit from day one.

---

## "Why not AGPL?"

Because AGPL is incompatible with sustainable SaaS development and does not
effectively prevent commercial parasitism or service cloning.

---

## "Why can't I host this myself?"

Because hosting and operating the platform **is the product**.

LibreMedia already provides a free non-commercial tier via the official SaaS.
Self-hosting or running your own service is outside the scope of permitted use.

---

## "Why allow pull requests if the product is commercial?"

Because transparency and quality benefit everyone.

Contributors submit changes knowingly and under clear terms.

---

## "What if I fork it privately?"

Forking or modifying the code beyond evaluation or contribution purposes
requires a commercial license.

Unauthorized use violates the license and applicable law.
